## Wiring:
Arduino +5V to breadboard power bus  
Arduino Ground to breadboard ground bus  
Jump button with 10k pull down to ground, and to digital pin 2, and other side to +5V.  
Duck button with 10k pull down to ground, and to digital pin 18, and other side to +5V.  
Passive buzzer with one side on ground and one side on digital PWN pin 5.  
16x2 16-pin Lcd screen with normal arduino wiring, as in the lesson for the lcd screen:  
* K to ground
* A to +5V
* D4 through D7 to pins 9 through 12
* E to pin 8 
* RW to ground
* RS to pin 7
* V0 to potentiometer output, for brightness, potentiometer is connected to +5V and ground
* VDD to +5V
* VSS to ground
